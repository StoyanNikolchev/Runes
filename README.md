The following is a Minecraft plugin designed to work with Spigot 1.19.x. The plugin provides:

* A variety of runes that give the player holding them a specific effect (Invisibility, Haste 2, Jump Boost 1, Fire Resistance, Night Vision, Slow Falling).
* Runes are obtained when a player kills a Wither, an Ender Dragon, or an Elder Guardian. The drop chance is 5% by default.
* Runes can also be given via the command "/rune give OnlinePlayerName RuneType/Random". This command requires the permission "runes.giveRune".

Disclaimer: I had a disclaimer but was told to remove it.
